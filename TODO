MEDIN METADATA TOOL: TODO
=========================

- Thesauri refdates (revision dates) should be moved to the term
  object, and these dates populated from the web service response
  where appropriate, defaulting to the system time if not available
  (i.e. in the case of ISO terms).

- The tool needs testing on a much broader input of data than that
  supplied with the BODC development database, which has
  inconsistencies (e.g. the frequency of update code specified in
  METADATA.FREQMOD_ID is 47, which is not a recognised code). In this
  and similar cases the tool is currently silent and forgiving,
  expecting the validation to catch errors. However, it would be
  useful if the tool emitted a warning when such situations are
  encountered.

- The first step in the validation process (checking against the ISO
  TC 211 schema) is currently not working properly, meaning the
  validation routine isn't useful at the moment. This is a libxml
  specific issue that needs to be investigated.

- Use the gmx:Anchor element within gmd:keyword elements where
  appropriate. This element substitutes for gco:CharacterString and
  works in the following way:

  <gmd:keyword>
    <gmx:Anchor xlink:href="http://vocab.ndg.nerc.ac.uk/term/P021/59/ZOOB">Zoobenthos taxonomy-related counts</gmx:Anchor>
  </gmd:keyword>

  instead of:

  <gmd:keyword>
    <gco:CharacterString>Zoobenthos taxonomy-related counts</gco:CharacterString>
  </gmd:keyword>
