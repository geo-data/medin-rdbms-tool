MEDIN METADATA TOOL: TODO
=========================

- Thesauri refdates (revision dates) should be moved to the term
  object, and these dates populated from the web service response
  where appropriate, defaulting to the system time if not available
  (i.e. in the case of ISO terms).

- The tool needs testing on a much broader input of data than that
  supplied with the BODC development database, which has
  inconsistencies (e.g. the frequency of update code specified in
  METADATA.FREQMOD_ID is 47, which is not a recognised code). In this
  and similar cases the tool is currently silent and forgiving,
  expecting the validation to catch errors. However, it would be
  useful if the tool emitted a warning when such situations are
  encountered.

- The tool should not only check to see if the user database supports
  the correct table and column names, but also that the columns are of
  the expected data type. See the email from Kay Thorne (Wed, 26 Jan
